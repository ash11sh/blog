      <description>intro I recently tried to implement code for trying out glass frames like snapchat filter. Used OpenCV and numpy for this process of overlaying frame. Result came out good for frontal posed face.
 demo - overlaying frame   But you need to give input image without wearing glasses to get better results. I tried giving an image of person with wearing glasses and it came out like this.</description>

      <description>intro I recently came across wildlife projects using AI and how they are helping in protecting endangered species and thought of making a model to help detecting tigers🐅 in the wild. Scroll down, too see how i trained my object detection model.
​
If you are active in computer vision, you may have heard about yolov5. There&amp;rsquo;s some controversy around its naming, you can read details from here. Ultralytics team put a great effort in open-sourcing this model 👏👏👏</description>

      <description>Intro Let me come to the point without any delay. You can serve your model as you think, and there is no set of rules for this. You can deploy through mobile app / web-app, there are plenty of guidance availble in vast internet. Or else you can get to your customers/users through a simple telegram bot. It is simpler than you think. Let&amp;rsquo;s go build it.
   Pre-requisites:   There are plenty of telegram bot wrappers available for python.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s bit of hectic process in creating image datasets. It Basically consists of below mentioned pipeline.(to my understanding)
 Model Bias. Whats your model goal? Ways to collect images. Cleaning the data. Resizing the images.   Model Bias Can you solve this riddle??
 A man and his son are in a terrible accident and are rushed to the hospital in critical care. The doctor looks at the boy and exclaims &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t operate on this boy, he&amp;rsquo;s my son!</description>
